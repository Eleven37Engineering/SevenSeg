Seven Seg
================

This project is to display characters on a seven segment display in an easy to use manner.

Use for whatever, no need to give credit, contribute if you see a problem.  Donations are a great idea, but we would rather see you develop your own library and evolve the world like we're trying to do.


Changelog
---------
0.0.1 - Inital creation of project - includes wiring diagram and old_code example of how the library was built.


Installation
------------

- Download the files
- Insert the source code into new files of the arduino project
- Add '#include <SevenSeg.h>' in your sketch


Usage
-----

This is still in full development for the wiring diagram please see: diagram.jpg
You can also see the Fritzing project under the fritzing folder.

This is a C++ library written to to operate in an object oriented manner.

You need to first create a new SevenSeg object

SevenSeg sevenSeg;

Then you can set the display like so:

sevenSeg.SetDisplay(1, 2, 3, 4);

Please reference the examples folder implementations of the code, we've tried to build this up to support many examples.
